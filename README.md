## Project Overview
Our project involves creating a replica of a Mars rover equipped with advanced features like: live video transmission to a webserver, robotic arm, virtual joystick controller, and environmental sensor.

## Key Components
### Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi serves as the brain of our rover, handling data processing, communication, and control functions. It's the powerhouse behind the rover's intelligence

### Live Video Transmission
We'll integrate a camera onto the rover, enabling a live video feed to a webserver. This feed is accessible via a Samsung tablet, allowing users to experience the rover's perspective in real-time. Plus, we're exploring the possibility of adding VR headset compatibility for an immersive experience.

### Joystick Controller
To maneuver the rover with precision, we'll design a user-friendly virtual joystick controller. It will communicate seamlessly with the Raspberry Pi, providing control over the rover's movements.

### DC Motors and Servo Motors
The rover's movements are powered by DC motors for driving and turning. Additionally, servo motors enable precise control over the camera's pan-tilt functions, enhancing the rover's observational capabilities.

### Temperature Sensor
Monitoring environment using chosen temperature sensor

## Project Goals
Our primary objectives for this project include:
- Creating a Functional Mars Rover Replica
- Establishing a Live Video Feed to a Webserver
- Developing a User-Friendly Joystick Controller
- Integrating Temperature Sensing for Environmental Data
